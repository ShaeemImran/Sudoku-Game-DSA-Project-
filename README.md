# Sudoku-Game-DSA-Project-JAVA

Overview:
This project is a fully functional Sudoku game developed using Java and NetBeans IDE.
The game allows players to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle where each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
The project demonstrates the use of data structures, algorithms, GUI design, and event handling.

Technologies Used:
* Programming Language: Java
* IDE: NetBeans
* GUI Framework: Java Swing

Data Structures:
* 9x9 2D array to store the Sudoku board
* Additional arrays to track prefilled cells and user inputs

Algorithms:
* Validation logic to ensure no repeated numbers in rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes
* Puzzle display ensuring the board is valid and solvable

GUI Features:
* Play, Restart, and Exit buttons
* Help section with instructions
* Interactive grid updates
* Wrong attempts counter
* Visual feedback for correct and incorrect inputs

Game Features:
* Restart option to reset the board
* Limited wrong attempts
* Real-time validation
* Remaining number count display
* Help button with scrollable instructions
* Exit option to return to the main interface

Output:
* Initial game interface
* Interactive playing interface
* Help and solution interface

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a strong understanding of Java programming, Java Swing GUI development, event handling, and logical validation algorithms. It combines problem-solving skills with user-friendly interface design.

Future Improvements:
* Random puzzle generation
* Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* Hint system
* Timer and scoring system
* Save and resume feature
* Enhanced UI themes and animations
